    Use this script to (re)build Predator and/or Forester against an arbitrary
    build of host GCC.  The host GCC needs to be built with the support for GCC
    plug-ins.  The recommended version of host GCC is 7.4.0 but Predator can be
    loaded also into older versions of GCC (plug-ins are supported since 4.5.0).
    For other versions of host GCC, please use the compatibility patches in the
    build-aux directory.

    GCC_HOST is a gcc(1) executable file that is built with the support for
    GCC plug-ins.  The most common location of the system GCC is /usr/bin/gcc.
    If you have multiple versions of gcc installed on the system, it can be
    something like /usr/bin/gcc-7.4.0.  You can also provide a local build of
    GCC, e.g.  /home/bob/gcc-7.4.0/bin/gcc.  Please avoid setting GCC_HOST to
    a ccache, distcc, or another GCC wrapper.  Such setups are not supported
    yet.

    On some Linux distributions you need to install an optional package (e.g.
    gcc-plugin-devel on Fedora) in order to be able to build GCC plug-ins.
