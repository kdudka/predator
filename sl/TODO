- check size of integers when accessing them by pointers, warn if a signed int
  is accessed as unsigned and vice versa

- allow to convert nullified integers, pointers, and strings as long as the
  sizeof allows to perform the conversion safely; shout otherwise

- allow to represent (possibly unterminated) strings of fixed length at the
  level of memory chunks (intervals)

- allow to represent arrays of fixed lengths in the same way as list segments
  are represented (it would allow to create hash tables of fixed length)

- trees in various forms that appear in real code

- choose some parts of applications and target them (for example drivers)

- create the test harness, maybe with some automation of the creation

- recursion at least for cut-point free programs

- analyze a non-recursive implementation of quicksort

- support for asymmetric predicates over integral ranges such that one can
  analyze NSPR arenas allocating blocks larger than arena size

  - one needs to track that values in one integral range are below another
    integral range point-wise

  - track information that x \in <A,B>, y \in <C,D>, and x < y (or something
    more general)

  - includes solving problems with join and call optimization

- option to introduce new Neq predicates on call of free() to improve reasoning

- option to show whole states leaking memory, not only the shape of leaked data

- allow creation of lists from blocks of different sizes, leading to lists of
  blocks of interval size

  >> Suggestions made by Hongseok Yang at CP-meets-CAV (June 2012) <<

- Some (Linux (?)) drivers use lists of nodes that contain some small
  array. The array is pointed from within the node via some field. If the space
  in the array is insufficient, an external array is allocated and the pointer in
  the structure is redirected to that array. Could we handle such a thing? It
  complicates the join, it seems more difficult to base it on graph isomorphism.

- Some Windows drivers use lists whose nodes are defined with a char[1] array at
  the end. In reality, however, one allocates a large chunk of memory and
  reinterpretes it such that it contains the list node structure at the beginning.
  The programmers can, however, use a longer array tha the declared one of
  length 1. To allow that, the list node structure contains a field giving the
  length of the array. The algorithms rely upon this length. Hence, one has
  to synchronize information about a data field and the size of the node.
  Interesting to look at (and perhaps take into account when improving the
  interval-based tracking of sizes and blocks). The example should be available
  on the web by googling for something like: windows driver char[1].

- As for the block operations, what about realloc?
