- check size of integers when accessing them by pointers, warn if a signed int
  is accessed as unsigned and vice versa

- allow to convert nullified integers, pointers, and strings as long as the
  sizeof allows to perform the conversion safely; shout otherwise

- allow to represent (possibly unterminated) strings of fixed length at the
  level of memory chunks (intervals)

- allow to represent arrays of fixed lengths in the same way as list segments
  are represented (it would allow to create hash tables of fixed length)

- get test-0707 from slayer working more efficient (we need to improve the join)

- trees in various forms that appear in real code

- choose some parts of applications and target them (for example drivers)

- create the test harness, maybe with some automation of the creation

- recursion at least for cut-point free programs

- analyze a non-recursive implementation of quicksort

- support for asymmetric predicates over integral ranges such that one can
  analyze NSPR arenas allocating blocks larger than arena size
  
  - one needs to track that values in one integral range are below another
    integral range point-wise

  - track information that x \in <A,B>, y \in <C,D>, and x < y (or something
    more general)

  - includes solving problems with join and call optimization

- option to introduce new Neq predicates on call of free() to improve reasoning

- option to show whole states leaking memory, not only the shape of leaked data
