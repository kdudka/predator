    Use this script to (re)build Predator and/or Forester against an arbitrary
    build of host Clang/LLVM. The host Clang/LLVM needs library and header files
    for develop native programs that use the LLVM infrastructure. The currently
    supported version of host Clang/LLVM is 3.8-dev but Predator can be loaded also
    into older versions of LLVM (3.5+, but correct output is guaranteed form 3.7).

    CLANG_HOST is the absolute path to clang(1). The most common location of the system
    Clang is /usr/bin/clang. If you have multiple versions of clang/llvm installed
    on the system, it can be something like /usr/bin/clang-3.8. You can also
    provide a local build of clang, e.g. /home/nika/clang+llvm-3.8-x86_64/bin/clang.

    On some Linux distributions you need to install an optional package (e.g.
    llvm-devel on Fedora) in order to be able to build LLVM pass.
