SLS abstraction
===============

    test-0001.c - infinite loop creating a SLL
                - it plots a heap graph per each iteration

                - thanks to the SLS abstraction, the program reaches its end
                  during the symbolic execution (though it can't happen in real
                  world as long as there is some memory available)

                - junk is properly detected since there is some memory
                  allocated, but nothing is free'd afterwards

    test-0015.c - creation/destruction of a cyclic SLL

    test-0038.c - simple SLL creation/destruction
                - one false alarm caused by the poor support of integral values
                - contributed by Petr Peringer

    test-0047.c - SLL creation, starting with uninitialized list pointer
                - because of the injected bug, it has to explore two times more
                  states

                - plots two heap graphs per each iteration (two variants
                  considered because of the uninitialized value mentioned above)

    test-0048.c - handling of shared/existential values during the abstraction

    test-0049.c - abstraction of SLL, each node contains a pointer to head
                - a few mistakes have been done in the test
                - see test-0118.c for the sane variant of this test

    test-0050.c - simple visualization of SLS abstraction in progress

    test-0051.c - SLS, each item owns its own on heap allocated object

    test-0052.c - regression test for SLS discovery (struct nesting, etc.)

    test-0053.c - SLS creation/destruction
                - a memory leak injected into the SLL destruction routine
                - can be turned into a leak-less example by the '#if 0' inside

    test-0065.c - SLL reversion with an ordering check
                - contributed by Tomas Vojnar

    test-0083.c - an example taken from fa_analysis
                - seen infinite because we abstract out integral values
                - it ignores the OOM state
                - no flaws reported with -fplugin-arg-libsl-symexec-args=fast

    test-0106.c - pseudo tree consisting of two SLLs
                - known to work with SE_COST1_LEN_THR == 4

    test-0112.c - hello-world, once used as the most trivial example for symjoin

    test-0113.c - error-free variant of test-0106
                - known to work with SE_COST1_LEN_THR == 4

    test-0118.c - abstraction of SLL, each node contains a pointer to head
                - improved variant of test-0049

    test-0119.c - a demo created as simplification of test-0118
                - tons of OOM errors
                - run with -fplugin-arg-libsl-symexec-args=fast
                - plots self-explaining heap graphs with DEBUG_SYMABSTRACT == 1

    test-0149.c - alternation of test-0052, which uses calloc instead of malloc

    test-0176.c - a possibly infinite SLL where nodes are just void pointers

    test-0193.c - a trivial example on use of joinData(), once used as a demo

    test-0194.c - a trivial example on use of joinData(), once used as a demo

    test-0195.c - a simplification of test-0193 that revealed a bug in symjoin

    test-0199.c - a stack implementation (contributed by Daniela Ďuričeková)


DLS abstraction
===============

    test-0054.c - simple DLL creation
                - seen infinite because we abstract out integral values
                - the fix-point calculation terminates thanks to DLS abstraction

    test-0055.c - a regression test focused on DLS discovery

    test-0056.c - a regression test focused on DLS shared data

    test-0057.c - concretization of DLS
                - it creates a (possibly infinite) DLL
                - the abstraction is triggered
                - the list is traversed from its one end to its other end
                  (concretization/abstraction)

    test-0058.c - alternation of test-0057.c
                - it creates a DLL of fixed length, though long enough to
                  trigger the DLS abstraction

                - as there is less non-determinism, it produces fewer graphs

    test-0059.c - forward/backward destruction of DLL

    test-0060.c - DLS abstraction of a cyclic DLL

    test-0068.c - a regression test focused on DLS discovery/abstraction

    test-0069.c - a regression test focused on handling of 1+/2+ DLS

    test-0082.c - a.k.a. jonathan-DLL.c
                - an example provided by Jonathan Cederberg
                - seen infinite because we abstract out integral values
                - does not care about the OOM state, what makes our analysis
                  a bit complex

                - works better with -fplugin-arg-libsl-symexec-args=fast

    test-0170.c - a NULL-terminated DLL with pointers to begin, end, and cursor
                - in order to not report artificial junk, needs to splice-out a
                  chain of DLS

    test-0171.c - a modification of test-0170 that revealed a nasty bug

    test-0214.c - randomly append/remove items from begin/end of the list

    test-0217.c - extension of test-0214 using a random seek in random direction

    test-0218.c - simplification of test-0217 not using structs at all


Higher level SLS/DLS abstraction, etc.
======================================

    test-0061.c - conversion of SLL to DLL and vice versa
                    1. creates a singly-linked list, using the 'next' selector
                       for biding

                    2. goes through the list and completes the missing values
                       of 'prev' selector, in order to obtain a doubly-linked
                       list

                    3. goes through the list and zero the 'next' selector
                       of each node, in order to get a reversed singly-linked
                       list

    test-0062.c - SLS nesting
                - a (possibly infinite) SLL
                - each node points to a standalone (possibly infinite) SLL

    test-0063.c - SLS of SLSs at end of another SLS
                - connected through incompatible pointer conversion
                - plots some heap graphs that explain a lot
                - mind the [prototype] prefix used in the SLS node visualization

    test-0064.c - more excessive test for SLS nesting and connecting

    test-0066.c - SLS of DLSs
                - a (possibly infinite) SLL
                - each node points to a standalone (possibly infinite) DLL

    test-0067.c - test-0066.c extended of two step destruction
                    1. the nested DLLs are destroyed
                    2. the master SLL is destroyed

    test-0070.c - distinguish among shared/prototype objects

    test-0071.c - SLL, each node points to a shared SLL

    test-0072.c - DLL, each node points to a standalone DLL
                - indirect function call (not so synthetic use case here)
                - bounded recursion of depth 2
                - see the function dll_create_generic() for details

    test-0110.c - top level SLL
                - odd nodes contain only one item of nested SLL (not a SLL)
                - even nodes contain two items of nested SLL
                - the same type is used at both levels, which helps negligibly

    test-0111.c - alternation of test-0110
                - two distinct types are used, which makes it harder to digest

    test-0116.c - alternation of test-0111
                - length of the nested SLL changes periodically: 1, 3, 0, 2
                - no way to analyse without three-way join of prototypes

    test-0230.c - non-artificial variant of test-0227.c

    test-0231.c - test-0229 forced to create SLS 0+ prior to entering the loop

    test-0232.c - merge of test-0230 and test-0231 resulting in double free

    test-0233.c - leak-less variant of test-0231

    test-0234.c - hierarchically nested SLS up to L5, properly destroyed

    test-0235.c - hierarchically nested SLS up to L5, bottom-up destructor

    test-0236.c - test-0234 with some direct up-links on top of it

    test-0237.c - test-0236 but also with some indirect up-links


Linux lists
===========

    test-0073.c - playing with some macros from <linux/list.h>
                - no abstraction involved
                - the heap graphs should be self-explaining

    test-0075.c - off-values handling, aliasing of the 1st field with the root
                - see the checks inside and the generated graph for more info

                - useful mainly for debugging purposes

    test-0080.c - Linux lists reduced to SLLs
                - traversal of the abstracted list

    test-0081.c - traversal of Linux like DLL
                - abstraction/concretization
                - some macros were expanded in order to make the code clear

    test-0084.c - destruction of Linux like DLL
                - the example itself is written a bit awkward, but works
                - successfully analyzed

    test-0085.c - regression test focused on aliasing of a field with the root
                - test for address comparison and call of free()
                - some of the tests are a bit crazy, however being used in
                  handling of Linux like DLS in some way

    test-0086.c - a simplified variant of test-0084.c that is closer to reality

    test-0087.c - alternation of test-0086.c where the list head is placed at
                  zero offset within each node (surprisingly it causes the
                  analysis to be much more difficult as the pointer-plus
                  operation vanishes when the offset is zero)

                - plots heap graphs of Linux like DLS destruction in progress

    test-0088.c - the core problem from test-0087.c narrowed down to a minimal
                  example

    test-0099.c - extension of test-0097, added two-level list destruction
                  (implies concretization at both levels)

    test-0101.c - Linux SLS with nested Linux DLSs, all properly destroyed

                  harder to analyse for us

    test-0105.c - Linux DLS with nested 0+ Linux DLS
                - a bit time consuming test-case for now

                  generically

    test-0107.c - Linux DLS with nested Linux DLLs consisting of _one_ item only
                - an extension of test-0104, which was even harder to deal with

                - once used as demo in slides about symdiscover
                - we needed something that is easy to plot
                - abstraction is triggerred only with SE_COST2_LEN_THR == 2

    test-0122.c - the most trivial case of Linux DLS abstraction
                - once used as demo in slides about symdiscover

    test-0151.c - regression test focused on gl variables, integral constants,

    test-0213.c - tiny modification of test-0212 that causes us problems


Show-case
=========
- Do we have any competitor in case of these examples?

    test-0037.c - glibc claims there is "double free or corruption"
                - valgrind says:
                    Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
                       at 0x4005DA: main (test-0037.c:28)

                    Invalid free() / delete / delete[]

                       by 0x4005F3: main (test-0037.c:31)
                    Address 0x4c4a040 is 0 bytes inside a block of size 8 free'd

                       by 0x4005E7: main (test-0037.c:29)

                - Predator says:
                    test-0037.c:27:11: error: type of the pointer being
                    dereferenced does not match type of the target object

    test-0102.c - a Linux DLS with two nested independent Linux DLSs
                - while destroying the whole data structure, we forgot
                  to destroy one of the sub-lits

                - Predator shows us where the call of a destructor belongs:

                    test-0102.c:84:13: warning: killing junk
                    test-0102.c:148:16: note: from call of destroy_top()
                    test-0102.c:141:5: note: from call of main()

    test-0131.c - combination of test-0037 and test-0073

    test-0137.c - successfully caught misuse of list_for_each() from Linux
                - contributed by Tomas Vojnar


Call cache
==========
    test-0041.c - infinite recursion
                - the analysis survives fairly well
                - the result is however not much useful

    test-0042.c - regression test focused on call cache
                - inspired by an already fixed bug there

    test-0043.c - regression test focused on call cache
                - inspired by an already fixed bug there
                - the comments inside are valid only with SE_DISABLE_SYMCUT
                - with symcut enabled, we have even more cache hits!

    test-0186.c - regression test focused on a fixed bug in gl vars optimization

    test-0187.c - test-0186 narrowed down to a minimal example

    test-0189.c - regression test focused on a fixed bug in gl vars optimization

"Hello world!" like examples
============================
    test-0002.c - invalid dereference
                - NULL value
                - an uninitialized value

    test-0003.c - invalid free()
                - uninitialized value
                - non-heap object
                - double free

    test-0004.c - infinite loop, one malloc() and one free() per each iteration
                - the analysis stops, though the program is infinite
                - there is no junk and no memory error possible
                - Predator issues a warning:
                    "end of function main() has not been reached"

    test-0005.c - non-recursive destruction of a SLL that consists of two nodes
                - OOM state is not handled properly and the analysis detects a
                  dereference of NULL value and possible junk as the consequence
                  of it

                - when analysed in "fast" mode, no flaws are detected

    test-0006.c - another variant of two nodes long SLL destruction
                - also reports problems caused by unhandled OOM state
                - silent in "fast" mode

    test-0007.c - indirect function call (trivial case)

    test-0008.c - indirect function call (more realistic case)
                - generic procedure that creates a fixed length SLL and call
                  a destruction routine, using a function pointer given as
                  argument

                - called two times with two different functions given as the
                  argument

                - once the test uses a loop-based SLL destruction routine
                - once the test uses a recursive SLL destruction routine
                - also a bit chatty when OOM errors are analyzed

    test-0009.c - checking of size of allocated memory (the easiest case)
                - based on type information of the pointer
                - as soon as the (void *) pointer is assigned to a type-safe
                  pointer, the size of _target_ type is compared with the size
                  given to malloc() as the argument

                - we support only constant parameters of malloc(), known in the
                  time of program's compilation

                - we don't support arrays at all (nor static, nor dynamic)

    test-0010.c - fixed length SLL creation/destruction
                - no OOM errors here
                - utilizes our garbage collector
                - Predator properly reports the junk, directly at the place
                  where it's introduced, along with full backtrace

    test-0012.c - another test-case for fixed length SLL creation/destruction

    test-0014.c - automatic regression test, based on dll.c/test-dll.cc
                - some noise that comes from unsupported handling of strings

                - reports an artificial memory leak caused by the abstraction

    test-0016.c - SLL creation, fixed length on bare metal
                - seen infinite because we abstract out integral values
                - the analysis terminates thanks to the garbage collector
                - no SLS abstraction involved here

    test-0017.c - an alternation of test-0016.c
                - seen infinite because we abstract out integral values
                - the analysis terminates thanks to finite number of states

    test-0033.c - two levels of doubly-linked lists
                - not many of nodes, some #if 1 inside

                - intentionally injected a bug into the example
